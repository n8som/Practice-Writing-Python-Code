# Practice-Writing-Python-Code

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Python is a programming language that helps in automating instructions to the computer in a variety of contexts, including security contexts. Writing code in Python is a valuable skill that helps security analysts thrive in their technical work.

In this lab, I'll practice writing my first Python code while learning about a notebook environment. The hands-on practice I engage in throughout the labs will help me apply Python coding skills to my work as a security analyst. 

<h2>Scenario</h2>

As a security analyst, I'll often use notebook environments and notebooks to write and run code. This lab will help me get familiar with working in a notebook environment, writing code comments in Python, and displaying strings with the print() function.

In this lab, I'll complete a series of tasks that involve observing and running some pre-written cells of text and code, as well as filling in cells with my own text, Python code, and code comments.

<h2>Task 1</h2>

The lab environment I'm working in is a notebook-based coding environment. Notebooks, such as this one, consist of two types of cells: (1) text cells, also known as markdown cells, and (2) code cells.

Markdown cells allow me to write plain text and format it in the markdown language. Markdown language is used for formatting plain text in text editors and code editors. For example, I can use markdown to make headers, bold or italicize words, format text as code, add hyperlinks, and more.

For this task, write something into the following markdown cell. When I have finished editing, press the Shift and Enter keys (or on some keyboards, the Shift and Return keys) to display my text.

<h2>Task 2</h2>

In Python notebooks, code cells allow me to write code comments and code in Python.

To run a code cell, I first place my cursor on the cell. Then, I can either click on the play icon or press the Shift and Enter keys.

For this task, run the following code cell as is and observe the output.

```# This cell displays "Hello world!"```
​
```print("Hello world!")```

The output only displays ```Hello world!``` out of the entire code cell. The quotations do not get outputted

<h2>Task 3</h2>

Writing code comments is a way to document the intention behind code. It's a standard that analysts commonly use in their workflow. Writing comments that accompany code allows me to keep track of the technical decisions I've made in my project. This makes it easier for me and my team to read and revisit my code to understand what it does and why I took certain approaches.

For this task, run the following code cell as is and observe the output.

In [ ]:

```# In Python, comments do not get displayed```

```# This code cell contains only comments```

Nothing gets printed to the screen.

<h2>Task 4</h2>

To type in a code cell, first click into the cell. Then I can write comments and code inside the cell.

For this task, add a comment at the beginning of the following code cell, describing what the code is doing. Write the comment to say # This cell displays "I am using Python.". Be sure to replace the # YOUR COMMENT HERE with my comment before running the following cell.

In [ ]:

```# YOUR COMMENT HERE```
​
```print("I am using Python.")```

Note: Once I click into the code cell, replace the placeholder comment with my comment. Recall that comments in Python start with the hash symbol (#).

<h2>Task 5</h2>

In Python, print() helps me to display information to the screen.

For this task, use print() to display the message "I am a security analyst." by placing that message within the parentheses. 

In [ ]:

```### MY CODE HERE ###```

<h2>Task 6</h2>

For this task, write a print() statement to display the string "Python is useful for security!" 

In [ ]:

```### MY CODE HERE ###```

<h2>Task 7</h2>

For my final task, I'll combine all the print() statements I've encountered and written in this lab up to this point, into one code cell.

Complete the following code with the remaining messages. 

In [ ]:

```### MY CODE HERE ###```

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

What are my key takeaways from this lab?

- It's helpful to use code comments to document the decisions I make as I code.
- Code comments are ignored by computers; they're read by me and my team to understand the intentions behind the code.
- I can write comments in Python using the hash symbol (#).
- I can use print() in Python to display information to the screen.
  - When I use print() to display a string, the quotes around the string do not appear in the output on the screen.
